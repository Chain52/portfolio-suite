# Server (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for a potential backend implementation. Currently, no server code is included.

## When This Will Be Used

A backend may be added in the future if one or more of the following needs arise:

- **API proxying**: To route external API requests through a server layer for security, rate-limiting, or caching.
- **Authentication**: To manage user sessions, OAuth flows, or secure access tokens.
- **Demo support**: If one or more live demos require server-side behavior that cannot be handled client-side (e.g., file uploads, database access, or background tasks).
- **Abstraction**: To offload complex logic from React Router loader/action functions into a dedicated API layer.

Until then, this folder serves as a placeholder and is not included in any build or deployment workflows.
